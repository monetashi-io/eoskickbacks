But note: reg-sub does not cause a node to be created.\n  It simply allows you to register the template from which such a\n  node could be created, if it were needed, sometime later, when the call\n  to `subscribe` is made.\n\n  reg-sub needs three things:\n    - a `query-id`\n    - the required inputs for this node\n    - a computation function for this node\n\n  The `query-id` is always the 1st argument to reg-sub and it is typically\n  a namespaced keyword.\n\n  A computation function is always the last argument and it has this general form:\n    `(input-signals, query-vector) -> a-value`\n\n  What goes in between the 1st and last args can vary, but whatever is there will\n  define the input signals part of the template, and, as a result, it will control\n  what values the computation functions gets as a first argument.\n\n  There's 3 ways this function can be called - 3 ways to supply input signals:\n\n  1. No input signals given:\n\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; (fn [db v]  ... a-value)\n\n     The node's input signal defaults to `app-db`, and the value within `app-db` is\n     is given as the 1st argument to the computation function.\n\n  2. A signal function is supplied:\n\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n       computation-fn)\n\n     When a node is created from the template, the `signal-fn` will be called and it\n     is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n     one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n     The values from the nominated signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to the\n     computation function - either a singleton, sequence or map of them, paralleling\n     the structure returned by the signal function.\n\n     Here, is an example signal-fn, which returns a vector of input signals.\n\n       (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n\n     For that signal function, the computation function must be written\n     to expect a vector of values for its first argument.\n       (fn [[a b] _] ....)\n\n     If the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n        (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n          (subscribe [:a-sub]))\n\n     then the computation function must be written to expect a single value\n     as the 1st argument:\n\n        (fn [a _] ...)\n\n  3. Syntax Sugar\n\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-b-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       :<- [:b-sub]\n       (fn [[a b] [_]] {:a a :b b}))\n\n  This 3rd variation is syntactic sugar for the 2nd. Pairs are supplied instead\n  of an `input signals` functions. Each pair starts with a `:<-` and a subscription\n  vector follows.\n\n  For further understanding, read `/docs`, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs\n  \"\n
